## Project Overview 

In this project with the help of a few visualizations you will be provided information about NYC CitiBike analysis.The analyzed data is from August 2019, and based on taht data we are trying to understand if introducig CitiBikes to Des Moines, Iowa, would be a feasible idea. 

In this analysis we have used a csv file from the NYCCitiBikes website which we converted to a dataframe in Python Pandas so that we can change the 'tripduration' column from an integer into a date time data type. While this can be done in another way, Python Pandas were used to avoid challenges with visualization. After the dataframe was convirted back into a csv file we have analyzed a number of trends which you will see as you scroll through the slides.
