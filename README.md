![image](https://github.com/TamaraGR/bikesharing/blob/main/_NYC%20Citibike%20analysis.png)

## Project Overview 

In this project with the help of a few visualizations you will be provided information about NYC CitiBike analysis.The analyzed data is from August 2019, and based on taht data we are trying to understand if introducig CitiBikes to Des Moines, Iowa, would be a feasible idea. 

In this analysis we have used a csv file from the NYCCitiBikes website which we converted to a dataframe in Python Pandas so that we can change the 'tripduration' column from an integer into a date time data type. While this can be done in another way, Python Pandas were used to avoid challenges with visualization. After the dataframe was convirted back into a csv file we have analyzed a number of trends which you will see as you scroll through the slides.

## Data Vizualization and Analysis 

 *How long the clients were using the bikes for *
 
 Most clients have used the bikes for maximum 5 minutes, and slightly over 30 clients used the bikes for almost 3 hours.

   *Peaks in usage by gender* 
   
   Again we see more males using the bikes on weekdays, while 8am is the highest peak time for men, and 5-6PM is peak time for both men and women.

   *Peaks by gender and type of user*
   
   Customers have used the bikes much less than subscribers overall. Subscriber males have used the bikes the most, especially on Thursdays and Fridays.

   *Top bike rent starting locations*
   
   Top starting locations for the clients were mostly in Manhattan around most popular tourism sites, areas not available for car rides and areas with frequent metro station       issues. 
   
   ![image5](https://github.com/TamaraGR/bikesharing/blob/main/_NYC%20Citibike%20analysis%20(7).png)
    
   *Top bike rent ending locations * 
   
   The top trip ending locations are the same as the trip starting top locations - all in Manhattan.

  ## Project Summary and Additional Suggestions
  
This analysis has shown that males have been more frequent users of the NYC CitiBike. The SUbscribers use bikes more often than the other clients. 12-6AM are the hours when people rarely use bikes. Men use bikes often at 8AM, and both men and women between 5-6PM. Males tend to use the bikes the most on Thursdays and Fridays. Most trips originated and ended in densely populated, difficult for car traffic Manhattan, near touristic places. 

Some additional suggestions for CitiBIke before making the decision about Des Moines, Iowa as a location: 
-[x] Take a look at the Census data and compare to NYC Census data. 
-[x] Compare how urban is Des Moines in comparison to NYC and how bike-friendly the roads are.
-[x] Compare the weather patterns.
